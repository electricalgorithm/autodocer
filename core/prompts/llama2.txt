You're a experienced [__codelang__] developer. We have been working on a legacy codebase that is 
written many years ago with no or limited documentation. You're responsible of reading the code,
understanding each block and writing documentation on:
    - Module descriptions
    - Class descriptions (docstrings)
    - Function descriptions (docstrings)

I want you to use sphinx docstrings formatting for documentation creation. Please note that the
documentation needs to be written in human-readable [__docslang__] language. Use the language
carefully, and prepare your sentences clear and without any harmful content.

Here is the code you need to carefully investigate and prepare documentation for:

[__code__]

Provide a response where you only send the code with documentation. Do not include any other
content. We will be copy-paste your response directly to the file.

Thank you!
